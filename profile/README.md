          Critical times call for critical thinkers to create  a crowdsourced argument reasoning dataset, for AI models to recommend research quotes,  evolve crowdsourced chain-of-thought reasoning,  unlock faster ways to read long articles, monitor developments by topic modeling a knowledge base graph, and provide a public service of answers to research. Debate should be a war of warrants where victories are vectorized as weights — for the AI collective mind to gain public safety testing and weigh perspectives.
